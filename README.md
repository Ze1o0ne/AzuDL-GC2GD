## Overview

**AzuDl - GC2GD** stands for:

> **Azizi Universal Downloader - Google Colab to Google Drive**

It is a Google Colab-based downloader that saves supported downloads directly into Google Drive.

Version **1.2.0** improves the original downloader with better torrent handling, `.torrent` file support, direct-link headers, YouTube metadata options, storage reports, SHA256 hashing, ZIP tools, and aria2 management utilities.

- `.torrent` files
- Batch downloads
- ZIP creation
- File integrity checking with SHA256

## Torrent Improvements in v1.2.0

Magnet links work in stages:

```text
Magnet link
  ↓
Metadata download
  ↓
Real torrent task
  ↓
Actual file download
```

Older versions could show only the metadata download, such as:

```text
Torrent: 100% 5.77k/5.77k
```

That was not the real file download. It was only the torrent metadata.

Version **1.2.0** detects the real torrent `GID` after metadata is fetched and monitors the actual file download.

Expected output:

```text
Magnet added
Metadata GID: ...
Fetching metadata: 100%
Metadata completed
Real torrent GID: ...
Starting torrent download monitor
Torrent Download: ...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Google Drive mount failed

Try:

```text
Runtime > Restart session
```

or run:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.flush_and_unmount()
```

Then restart the runtime.

Other fixes:

- Use only one Google account in the browser
- Open Colab in Incognito mode
- Allow third-party cookies
- Reconnect Google Drive manually from the Colab file panel

### Torrent metadata downloads but real file does not start

Possible reasons:

- No seeders
- Weak torrent
- Metadata found but no peers available
- Network restrictions

Use:

```text
14. aria2 status
```

to inspect active, waiting, and stopped tasks.

### YouTube download fails

Try updating yt-dlp:

```python
!pip install -U yt-dlp
```

### Direct link fails

Possible reasons:

- Expired link
- Missing headers
- Server blocks Colab
- Authentication required
- Temporary token expired

Try using custom headers JSON.
